# ML_643
Reinforcement learning Q-table, ML 643 class final project  

Hill-climbing for cancer molecular subtype prediction scores.  

An hyperparameter combination search using an adaboost classifer. The classifiier config and resulting prediction scorees are the environment. The Q-table serves as the agent's memory for managing the exploration vs exploitation. Boosted accuracy (6/6 test runs) from random intitial hyperparameter combinations on TCGA data for adrenocortical carcinoma. Discovered performant hyperparameter combinations in search space expanded beyond range used for devel.
